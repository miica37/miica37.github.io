### Image Tips
The images of this website are sized to fit the width of its content area (instead of displaying at its real size), so for some images you will be able to see a larger resolution of it by 

 * Right click on the image
 * Select “Open Image in New Tab”

### Getting Help & Supports
You can post your questions at Unreal Marketplace or send me an 📧 Email: miicaneo@gmail.com.

(Note that as for now, I am usually away from my PC at Friday but I will try my best to respond as soon as I can.)

#### Alternative 2: Post your issues at Github
I also am experimenting using github for users to submit issues. Check out https://github.com/miica37/Rabbit-Heart-Characters/issues and post any issues you have with any of my characters.

You can also let me know of any features or additional things that you would like have and I will see if I am able to do it 🙂
