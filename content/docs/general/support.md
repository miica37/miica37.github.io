### Getting Help & Supports
You can post your questions at Unreal Marketplace or send me an ðŸ“§ Email: miicaneo@gmail.com.

(Note that as for now, I am usually away from my PC at Friday but I will try my best to respond as soon as I can.)

#### Alternative 2: Post your issues at Github
I also am experimenting using github for users to submit issues. Check out https://github.com/miica37/Rabbit-Heart-Characters/issues and post any issues you have with any of my characters.

You can also let me know of any features or additional things that you would like have and I will see if I am able to do it ðŸ™‚
