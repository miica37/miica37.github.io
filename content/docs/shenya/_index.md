Materials
--------------------

### Design Material
The master materials with "_Design" in their names allows you to overlay a design image on top of base color texture.

![Design Master Material in Content Folder](img/designs/design-master-material-in-content-folder.jpg)

These are the parameters, you can Move/Rotate/Flip/Stretch the image and also change the brightness (Parameter: Design Power), color tint and opacity of the design image.

![Design Material Parameters](img/designs/design-material-parameters.jpg)

Shenya comes with some designs that you can use, but of course you can import your own design. All the provided images contains alpha/transparency.
